Freight Forwarding is a small overhaul with a focus on long-distance logistics variety.

Technology progression is carefully balanced around the custom island map generation and resource placement. For effective transport, items must now be loaded into containers before travel, but since items are being transported so compactly, transfer from trains to ships is much more straightforward.

# Progression

### Start

Use the basic resources (iron, copper, stone, and coal) to produce Automation and Logistics sciences.
**Unlocks**:
- Trains
- Container loading
- Lead processing

### Transport science

Lead ore is required for Transport science and always spawns at the edge of your starting island, so trains are required to access it. Explore containerization of resources before loading them onto trains.
**Unlocks**:
- Ships
- Basic oil processing

### Chemical science

Oil only spawns in large offshore patches at sea, so you'll need to use oil rigs and tanker ships to retrieve it.
**Unlocks**:
- Deep sea dredging
- Titanium processing
- Uranium processing

### Advanced resources

Titanium and Uranium only spawn on other continents, so you will load them into containers at their mines and transport the containers using combinations of ships and trains.
**Unlocks**:
- Spidertron automation
- Hovercrafts

### Production / Utility sciences

Expansion onto other continents for larger patches of basic resources will be required.
**Unlocks**:
- Aircraft
- Cobalt processing
- Titansteel processing

### Rocket launch

Rocket parts require Titansteel, which can only be forged in naturally-occuring lava pools using steel and titanium plates for the ultimate logistics challenge! Combat aircraft have a very large radar area, so can be used to explore large areas of the map using remotes.

# Other features

### Containers
- Stack sizes of all raw and intermediate resources has been halved compared to vanilla
- One container holds 20 stacks (10x density compared to vanilla)
- Inventory sizes have been reduced to compensate, so trains and ships have had their inventory sizes divided by 10
- Other vehicles and containers have had their inventory sizes divided by 2
- Containers are very heavy, so transporting them by logistic robots is prohibited
- Empty containers can be loaded into spidertrons using docks, but spidertrons also cannot carry loaded containers

### Landfill
- Landfill and rail bridges cannot be placed on deep water
- Landfill can now be removed by right-clicking on it whilst holding a tile in hand
- Stone bricks and concrete cannot be placed on landfill

### Map generation
- Custom map generation originally based on [Island Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IslandStart) featuring a completely isolated starting island surrounded by larger islands and continents
- Resource patches are larger but further apart
- Resource spawning is based on invisible 'regions' so certain resources will often spawn near each other and even larger continents won't feature too many different resource types
- Oil only spawns in water

### Seismic scanner
- Seismic scanner scans a bigger range than radar, but only through connected landmasses
- Ideal for scanning the entirety of a newly discovered island
- Cannot be placed within 16 tiles of water

### Deep sea dredging and cobalt
- Seamounts (underwater mountains) spawn in deep water
- Place dredging platforms on them, which are limited in size
- Dredge up ferrous and cupric nodules which can provide infinite supplies of iron, copper, and stone, supplementing your regular resource mines
- Later, unlock cobalt crust, which can be processed into cobalt ingots on land

### Titansteel and Lava pools
- Lava pools occur naturally in far-away islands
- Steel plates and titanium plates can be inserted into lava pools to create hot titansteel plates (which also produces slag as a byproduct)
- Hot titansteel plates can be cooled into Titansteel plates, which produces lots of steam (so doubles up as a power source)
- Titansteel can be reheated in small lava pools if you want to expand the power production
- Slag requires sulfuric acid to process, which returns small amounts of iron ore and stone
- Titansteel is used in rocket construction

### Battery charging
- Battery items can be charged in the charging station
- Energy stored in charged batteries can be used in the discharging station
- Floating power poles (from Cargo Ships) have been removed, so you on each island you will have to setup power production or import electricity using containerized charged batteries
- Steam cannot be loaded onto tanker ships

# Included Mods

Some of Freight Forwarding's functionality is provided by other, required, mods. Many things from these mods have been changed to fit into the overall balance and progression, so if you find a bug in them, please confirm that it still occurs without Freight Forwarding enabled before reporting it to that mod's owner, or report it to me and I can let you know whether it's my bug or not.

- [Deadlock's Crating Machine](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/DeadlockCrating): provides graphics and basic functionality for loading containers, although all recipes and icons have been replaced
- Water mods
    - [Cargo Ships](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cargo-ships): large inventories for transport across water; oil rigs for drilling oil in the ocean
    - [Canal Builder Simplified](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/CanalBuilderMAV): allows placing shallow water adjacent to existing water
    - [Beautiful Bridge Railway for Cargoships](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beautiful_bridge_railway_Cargoships)
    - [Underwater Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/underwater-pipes): construct offshore oil rig infrastructure without landfill
    - [Hovercrafts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Hovercrafts): easier navigation across both water and land
- [Spidertron Patrols](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpidertronPatrols): useful for transporting items which can't be loaded into containers
- [Lex's Aircraft](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/lex-aircraft): late-game alternative to spidertrons, for automation of product logistics over land and sea
- [BZ Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead)
- [BZ Titanium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztitanium)

# Information

### Other mods
I'd recommend installing [Freight Forwarding Pack](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FreightForwardingPack), which provides a few extra challenges in other areas of gameplay.

Enemy difficulty has not been changed, but because of the island/continent-based map generation, enemies may be easier than normal. I'd recommend [Armoured Biters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ArmouredBiters) (make sure to enable custom nests in mod settings), [Explosive Biters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Explosive_biters), [Frost Biters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cold_biters), and [Toxic Biters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Toxic_biters) if you want an extra challenge.

Compatible with [AAI Industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-industry). For additional complexity, you can try installing other [BZ Ores](https://brevven.github.io/bz/), although I haven't tested them so they don't have the custom resource spawning and there may be tech/progression softlocks.
Not compatible any other overhaul mods (such as Bob's+Angel's, Krastorio2 and Space Exploration). Maybe in the future I will add compatibility with some overhauls, perhaps Krastorio, Industrial Revolution, or Exotic Industries, but this is unlikely to ever happen. Let me know if you'd be interested in any particular overhaul compatibility.

For quality of life, you are free to choose your own. You can see my general recommendations [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/X-QoL).

Other small-to-medium mods will probably work, although may break the intended balance/progression. Fully compatible with [Alien Biomes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alien-biomes).
